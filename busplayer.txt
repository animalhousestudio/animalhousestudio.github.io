for my daughter, who always believed in me.
TAGLIA

it doesn't start like this, but one day the gentleman had an incredible adventure:
he had woken up at night and from his bed had gone out into the street to take the bus, with no particular thoughts or strange ideas.
he had paid a different attention than usual to what was happening around him.
it had seemed to him that things had a greater importance.

with some effort, his own thoughts formed more slowly, and the colors of things seemed darker.
he felt his body heavy, and a buzz at the bottom of his stomach.
the sky was falling to pieces and dripping onto the street and the buildings, covering the lettering of the signs and filling the spaces between the cars, hitting the asphalt with a dull thud.
not at all distracted, he began to walk more slowly, his legs heavy. he slowed down again. the buzz in his stomach grew.
a waving sound began, starting from a hidden point near the nape of his neck, and shortly after it reached his nostrils with a scent of incense.
the gentleman tried to slap his neck but realized his hand was moving very slowly.
TAGLIA

suddenly he found himself in the dark, and his legs had fallen asleep.
- i'm not scared yet.
there was a single point of light at the far end, in front of him, and it was in that direction that mr. shittyevening was pointing his eyes.
- i'm not sure.
he fumbled in his pockets, fiddled with something inside and pulled out a remote control.
- this thing doesn't work.

the buzz in his stomach became a roar, moved into his chest.
he lost contact with the ground, for a few seconds he remained standing as if nothing had happened, then he got scared, and began to fall, flailing his legs and arms, the wind blowing his clothes in his face.
- everything's fine, it's just a surge of weakness.
and a fraction of a second later he was still again in the dark: there was nothing anywhere anymore.
he felt his ankles and began to scratch them with his nails.
he went on for a while, until he detached them, grabbed them with his teeth and it seemed to him that he had put them in his pockets, big wide pockets.
then he remembered he still had hands.
(and these?)
he let out a sound of frustration, as the roar in his chest became a whistle in his neck.
TAGLIA

- it's almost choking me.
he lifted himself up on his hands but all the blood rushed to his head, so with the first hand he detached his head by pulling it by the hair, balancing on the other, and stuck it in his ass with a swift gesture, he pushed.
with his head in his ass at first he saw nothing, but his body didn't give a damn and advanced towards the light.
and suddenly everything was explained:
a bonfire, in the pierced forest, illuminates a clearing where twelve chubby bonzes dance in a circle, they are all tied together by a single ponytail that joins them from head to head.
in front of this circle of bonzes dance twelve crabs in a circle, moving counter-clockwise.
in front of the crabs there are leftovers of food and then the fire, which crackles upwards with a confident air.
mr. headinass arrived hopping on his only free hand (the other was busy squeezing a protuberance in the hope of getting his head out.)
- who are you lot? - he asked.
- we are the virgin mary! - the bonzes replied.
- and jesus christ! - the crabs.
- and the holy spirit. - the food scraps.
- who are you lot? - the fire then asked.
- i can't get my head out. - said the gentleman.
- you should boil it. - said the bonzes without stopping their dance.
- i'll take care of it. - said a crab, and leaving the dance he threw himself into the flames.

TAGLIA

an excruciating pain hit the young carnalsewage in the stomach.
- i can't go on like this! - he begged.
- oh yes you can, you are a polite person! - the bonzes replied.
- of course! - said the crabs one after another, breaking from the line and forming a circle in front of him.
- i feel something strange, in my dick...
the bonzes threw themselves into the flames and the flames became a green siren, from its head came green fumes that aimed at the gentleman's senses and pushed towards all sorts of confusion.
the crabs started to laugh.
from the tip of his dick a claw appeared, then the head, then the whole crab.
the baby crab came down to the ground and was welcomed by the other celebrating crabs, they started dancing around him again.
- you can't afford a break. - said the siren.
- but i have a terrible pain in my dick.
and from his dick came out a bonze, soaked in urine, blood and clotted sperm.
he got behind the crabs and resumed the dance. and one after another all twelve came out of there, the young boneless man lay on the ground almost unconscious.
- oh poor me, oh god.
and while he was complaining about the pain he had strangely precise visions of trivial events that had happened in other places.
when they were all around him the siren said:
- good.
and at that point his head came out of his ass, making a stupid sound.
TAGLIA

the head fell to the ground from the ass and split in two like a coconut.
inside there were a dozen dead flies and a brain the size of a fist, beating like a still-living heart.
- you're not going to eat it, are you? - said the siren.
- oh, shut up. - a bonze protested.
the crabs turned off the light and left.

and that's it

at the workplace, his colleagues didn't feel comfortable: because of his wide jaw, his square knees, his features drawn with a light hand, the never-corrected habit of muttering curses in the silence of the office.
- one day the hoarseness will carry mr. rotisserie away. they would sneer and spit, always.
- one day it will carry him away on golden wings.
he had walked until he was tired, in the dark countryside, trying to remember what he might have forgotten in the house by the lake: a flashlight, or hooks, a piece of rope, or a reflective mirror.
he would go to the warehouse to retrieve the still-living fish, grab them from the bucket and slam them against the walls.
he would turn the octopuses inside out and his cheeks would flush. with each blow a brief

TAGLIA

laugh would leave his chest.
then he would go out with his bag full and his breath cut short, and the old women who watched him walk through the night would say to him:
- what does he want?
what does he want?
he climbed among the rocks and bushes with the fish banging like stones in a river, and his hat drowning, pushed by the wind.
and in the end he would give up, and he would fly too.
and in more than sixty years he had never missed a train, although he had never seen a mountain or a hill, a foreigner
behind the station he sat every day to listen to the white lady who every day said to the black gentleman, about the ministry's filming, in the film shot simultaneously by the ten directors.
- they filmed him from behind, you know? as if he were an inner tube about to explode.
as if he had antennas painted white and a transparent signal on the windows.
and eighteen directors argued and exchanged hats and mustaches and transparent glasses, hastily sitting on this or that chair.
then he would intervene with a joking comment that sounded out of place and filled him with embarrassment.
but the two gentlemen always proved to be kind, laughing politely and thinking about something else.
the train before arriving would rear up and slam on the tracks for a few seconds, the windows would open and people would come out of all the holes.
mr. rotisserie would climb up and always enter from the back, where there are

TAGLIA

fewer people.
and when the train passed over the bridges he would watch the traffic, and it seemed to him like a cascade of insects with luminous eyes.
after getting off the train every form of life would jump on him insulting and scratching him, but he would smile, smooth his tuft of hair on his forehead, throw a few coins on the ground and dive in.
he would reach the exit without ever pulling his head out of the water. then he would brush the sand off his back and put on a black car, small and with a low roof.
there were checkered ornaments, as a memory of his racing days as a youth. and small drawings of women who had hated him.
on the yellowish walls children had stuck chewing gum.
in a small box in the glove compartment he kept his daughter's baby teeth.
he kept the broken nails of his childhood behind his ears.
every day he saw in the sky a tree-lined avenue and on the trees roses that fell on out-of-focus mirrors.
if he had ever owned ten hectares of land he would have dug holes and filled them with excrement, covered them with bay leaves and would have gone to rest near a stream forgetting everything.
he would have collected stones from the water and thrown them to the other side.
he would have climbed trees and falling would have cursed bad luck and the devil.
he would have lit fires in the woods and would have gotten into a sack hoping to fall asleep, keeping his eyes so tightly shut that they would water.
he would get up and in the middle of the night he would walk until he got lost among the trees.
at dawn he would wake up, dirty and smelly, with one eye lowered in an

TAGLIA

unnatural way, his gums blackened.
he would have collected a handkerchief of dignity from a black pit, he would have thrown it out to dry in the sun.
he rests the car against a glass and enters by climbing the walls, from the window right into the house:
he places the harpoon in his throat, collects the cigarette butts and puts them in his pocket, gets undressed and puts on a cordial expression, his daughter is sawing the kitchen table.
she looks at him and doesn't recognize him, she says to him:
- hi, pa!
and he, peeling his gums, forgives her foolishness:
- prepare me a nice egg, will ya!
and she, laughing, smashes a big egg on his forehead, making his nostrils faint as the yolk drips down his round face.
- are you crazy, my daughter!
- shut up, shut up!
she screams and bursts into tears in a corner, getting smaller and smaller until she disappears.
TAGLIA

so mr. barnowl (the name is always the same) would peel the roots from the trees and gild the barks with bee cream, killing time just so.
under the leaves that fell like a flood he watered the trunk and the roots of the dancing substance, he hopped in the puddles.
he had a white face and walked in the blowing forest like the little lord he was, mr. goodstorm (always).
he gathered large pieces of broken wood to draw horns on a felled deer.
and he was so young that his present, feeling suffocated, had taken billions of leaps forward, grabbing old mr. goodfortune by the neck.
- to pull it with the nails, the nails, under the branches.
and so pleased and happy the child was like an old gentleman lost in a delightful dream of nostalgia.
and in the green night his regrets were extinguished, with a crackling little fire, like astonished mosquitoes that burn against a winter sunset in an electric racket.
he was lying on the water, with a seagull on his back eating his brain from his uncovered skull.
he climbed up an intestinal rope that took him to the moon to gather mushrooms.
if he ever got into big trouble, the kind boys get into, his mother would pick him up from the ground and tuck him under her hat, repeat hail marys, cross herself and put out all the candles in the church, making sure the priest didn't notice her.
then she would hide in the confessional, to eat hosts stained with dental plaque.
and doctor snake-crusher listened to him the whole time without saying anything and without daring to think.
so it was that he had a calm and unhappy childhood! the end! wait.. wait..
so mr. spitroast fell in love over nothing, lost his head over nocturnal ghosts, distracted inventions, danced in halls soupy with smoke and lay down exhausted with his head split between death and youth.
he had hallucinations every day for hours and hours. and since his incapable youth was short, so ends the chapter.
wait.. wait.. what a hurry!
- give me freedom, give me freedom.
he always shouted, and no one answered him.
- there is no freedom.
everyone always answered him.
and he always shouted - save me, save me.
but no one answered him.
- you are already saved.

TAGLIA

each one answered him with the face of jesus christs, from the white of the sand and under the dense sea.
so

one summer day his mother took him with her and took him for a walk along a road covered with dark gravel.
the thistles despaired in a dance towards the sun. grains of hope rolled as if they had an actual shape in the air.
there was a funereal amusement park with round red tents and greenish-blue slides.
the smashed metal gate and the desolation, in the middle of the village.
and they walked along the road and the boy after throwing stones at the hissing lizards would fall to his knees and cry, terrified at the idea of having hit them.
and the mother would stretch him by dragging him. and the knees of his ripped jeans scraped on the gravel, splattering it with blood and brilliant sparks.
and every metallic animal that peeped out clanking from a dune was sent flying with sharp stones, those stones that are used to scratch the foreheads of old people and draw on them.
the horizon jumped at his throat like a wolf, but it's not true: his mother gutted it with the big knife from the small kitchen.
and reading its entrails she showed young song-cock the bay before them - with the sea of oil and the mountains with the curves of a fat woman.
TAGLIA

mammah grabbed him by the hair, and no matter how much he shrieked and screeched - she dragged him to the well of the bay and immersed him up to his eyes.
the eyes of young glass-shatterer stuck very quickly into something, the mother still held him like that and yelled at him that he was a piece of filth and a rag .. and then she threw him into the sand, and spreading with force and singing:
i had a son, a beautiful son,
and one fine day with a fine rolling pin,
i flattened him into a little figure in the sand of the sea,
in the same shape as the sea.
the young chestnut-roaster burst into desperate tears and then his mother looked at him closely and laughing said:
- don't cry!
don't cry, it's just a thorn.
and so saying she extracted the long fishbone from his ear.
and he still crying and shouting thanked her and hugged her, and then together they returned home.
the large building where they lived overlooked the dock to the south and the sea to the west.
every winter it was invaded by frogs, and the young green-pine would collect them and throw them excitedly at his mother, who would smile and say:
- leave me alone, little froggy.
TAGLIA

but he would continue until she grabbed him and made him swallow them, then they would laugh together and watch little mr. paper-crusher putting frogs back.
since they were a very poor family they couldn't afford sunlight, and were forced to turn on whitish light bulbs from morning to night.
and every time the young one opened a window a little, his mother and grandmother got so angry that big water bubbles appeared on their wide faces.
the grandmother of young meat-grinder was named melissa and always dressed in black for church reasons.
she wore large black glasses attached to her ears by means of two pitchforks that disappeared into her eardrums.
she had short white hair cut in the old fashion. small gray birds always hid in her hairstyle as soon as she left the house and she would get very angry and shoo them away with her hands, screeching in dialect: - go away! go away!
as a young woman she had had a very long list of lovers who had abandoned her, sailing off to sea, and for this reason every time she looked out the window she shouted furious insults at the waves of oil.
and the young good-news hearing her so angry would become sad and tell her little stories:
- there was a little bear with a tawny coat that hid in a long, narrow cave.. but grandma melina ignored him and continued to shout.
in the evening he would fall asleep listening to his mother and grandmother sing little songs in their language, whatever it was.
TAGLIA

in the evening he never fell asleep, because his mother and grandmother left him alone, and he feared solitude like a young man on the verge of madness.
he feared solitude like a wolf, like an old man, like a forgotten poet.
on the crumbling walls hung dried fish and pieces of stale bread.
he would stay up all night staring at the loaves and fishes and never slept.
every night jesus christ appeared and multiplied the loaves and fishes, every morning hundreds of cats arrived and devoured everything.
every night the fisher king arrived and fixed new fish to the walls.
every morning the farmer arrived with a large brown sack and baked the old bread on his feverish forehead, then he would greet him laughing and go to sell the bread as if freshly baked in the village, walking in the sky clinging to the clouds.
and every morning the grandmother would curse - she would come to wake him up and hang the leftovers on the wall.
every night fish would jump from the sea through the window into his bed and tell him stories, then fearing being eaten they would slip into his breakfast bread.
every morning as soon as young juice-squeezer woke up his mother would take the leftovers and stick him in an alcove in the wall.
hundreds of old women with their faces covered by a black cloak would enter and pray for hundreds of hours to hundreds of gods.
when glass hailed, frozen grapes would slip under the bed, and the young one would count them all night.
sometimes such large pieces of glass rained down that entire buildings collapsed, terrifying the grandmother who

TAGLIA

pretended to laugh to hide her fear.
then young field-jumper would look out and watch the mice that shot out from the rubble in all directions, he would zap them with his flashlight and peel them, loudly: - who goes there!
who goes there!

at sunrise he would stand up, climb up standing, stretch out standing and at the window he would shout:
- good morning!
i love myself! i love myself! i love everyone!
and the two old ladies just laughed.
rather
young story-counter walked on the asphalt, stomping his feet and swinging his shoulders.
curly was chewing an american gum and squinting at the weeds sizzling in the sun at the edge of the road.
- and what are we going to do? young man?
- oh, shut up. and he shook his arms and laughed.
- but you know we're not here anymore? that we're dead?
- what are you saying?
you want to give me a heart attack?

TAGLIA

- just kidding, come on!
and he would pull a small metal coffin out of his pocket, throw it at me, laugh.
- and what is this?
- AND HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
- and what does it mean?
- of course you always want to know everything..
- well, it seems appropriate.. and then he'd get angry, i think, and leave.
the dock was a kaleidoscope of phosphorescent colors from pink to dark green, and these colors changed continuously with the sun.
the boys skirted it - curly with his chin up and hands on his hips, playing the expert, and young hundred-cinders with his hands in his pockets, and pretending to be experienced.
the rusty boats banged against the reinforced concrete, casting brief sparks: with each bang, small silver fish emerged from the brackish water - they looked around as if just awakened, then disappeared.
from time to time a hoarse cry broke the silence, which for the rest minded its own fucking business.
now the boys were in the perfect center of the village - and their plastic boots crumbled the thin layer of red sand that covered the avenue of azaleas.
curly grabbed a street sign from the ground and threw it, laughing.
it landed a few meters away with a sad noise.
TAGLIA

curly had arrived a few years ago with the high waves, he was a boy with frizzy hair, who originally was inside an egg.
mother and grandmother had found him wrapped in seaweed and couldn't decide if he was man or fish.
they had set fire to everything and had gone to sit a little further away to watch it burn.
a little later, forgetful, they had returned home.
from the window overlooking the beach, young net-detacher had seen a fire spirit running towards the village coppola shouting and spitting flames.
he had run down the streets in pursuit.
the spirit fled to the poisoned dock, and then inside and died dead, casting its specter into the sky in the form of venomous fumes.
young rat-snapper had said a few distracted prayers with one eye closed, and the other half-open to peek.
after a few hours curly had fallen ruinously to the ground from the cut sky, his skin carbonized, his hair eaten away and his eye glassy.
he had laughed and hugged him. from then on great friends.
- come, come, brother fish, let's have a party, come on, don't make me beg.
'cause i know you're bored down there, what are you doing there?
it's all dark and the same, what if a smarter fish passes by, eats you, then what do you know.. one day you find yourself all alone 'cause all the other fish leave, and what do you do?
ah look, it's bad to be alone, you know? it's so cold and everything is so sad. what do i know, you say?
eh, i know what i know, 'cause it's a lifetime i'm never alone.
always light and joy, my fish. you see those things up there? eh, yes.
those once were water fish like you, then one fine day

TAGLIA

they understood they gained nothing from being there snoozing like idiots and they came up here and they grew some wings.. but what wings!
you see them, now? they fly up around the sun when they're cold and lie down behind the moon when they're hot.
and they don't even remember the water, you know? they think they were born in the air, halfway between a pierced forest and a man without eyes intent on picking olives.
and in the end the fish was convinced and came out of the water, curly quickly pulled out a big knife and cut it in half, mr. net-remover always took the head part and swallowed it in a single bite, saying every time "what a delicatessen".
then the boys would take the scales and polish them, cover their faces and go running through the town, shouting:
- it's the end of the world, it's the end of the world, run!
what's the use of running anyway? but no one listened to them.
curly always said a lot of bullshit.
the story of the man without eyes, however, was true, more or less.
halfway to the pierced forest, coming from the village, there was a side road that drew a wide curve under the rock and the cut branches - for a few hundred meters.
on one side of the road grew some of those short curved trunks, some with arms full of some red berries and some dry leaves.
in the air resounded some continuous chirping of crickets and the peevish cry of Some birds.
TAGLIA

and right there an old lady was walking with the air of not quite knowing. a sooty little boy was following her.
- i'm sleepy, i'm sleepy, i'm sleepy, when do we get there?
- eh, i can't stand to hear you complain anymore, i have short legs..
- i don't give a fuck!
- what a way to talk! i'll show you your mother later..
- i don't give a fuck!
- oh yes, a fuck.. what do you know what a fuck is?
and for all response, the young boy ran in front of her and unbuttoned his pants, and with his hand sticking out of the open fly he mimed ..
the old woman then burst out with a cry with difficulty, leaned over to grab him and fell to the ground.
- stupid old woman! old bitch!
and so he left, leaving her there all alone to mind her own fucking business and to die for all he cared.
he started hopping away, getting further and further away like a kind of fucking dot on the horizon, and she remained on the ground complaining and after seeing the roses grow she went back home sliding along the curve of the little road.
and the boy, climbing up the curve of the little road, ran among the olive trees and laughing lived for a few years, doing his own little things and picking red berries and hunting crows.
TAGLIA

and like me he got older and older and the thorns pierced more and more of the thirty-three hands he had, and his droppings were redder and redder from the berries, and he found it harder and harder to chase away the crows.
and he had less and less fun, and in the end the camorristi came, they gouged out his eyes and left him there to mind his own fucking business, and his old aunt came back and pissed in his empty sockets, and that's that.
quickly
and when the smelly shadows of the village buildings stopped drawing themselves in front of his feet, and when the weeds and the asphalt gave way to the earth and the iron grates.
in front of him stood the blowing pine forest, or the forest.
he, is mr. frank-part, still young, still convinced of his right to live. he leans, he is tired: against the masonry.
he pushes himself against a grate and peeks peeps peels the trees.
he has always loved, our friend log-breaker.
he used to climb trees and fumble with beehives when he was still in his mother's belly, he would smooth them and prepare them for large-scale sale, when he worked at the factory, he would lick them and boil them, and they would last a long time in cans in his living room: because he closed the jars with his teeth - but he often cut his lips and broke his molars, with those jars, even if he was ashamed to say it / and he certainly didn't go telling it to anyone / like that brown-haired woman who gave him dirty looks sitting on the edge of the dock
and that every time she

TAGLIA

could she would blow on him, and once curly stuck a stick in her eye and she hated him and it all ended in friendship but when they broke her legs they also broke her bones.
they had arrived in the pine forest passing through a dark hole in curly's pierced room, without ever looking directly at the blowing pine forest.
he couldn't look at the blowing pine forest by chance, he could only look at it directly, for example when he passed in stolen cars on the median axis, his grandmother and his mother would pull his ears,

quickly

and someone said to him: - something?
pulling him by the shirt towards the grass with strong arms.
he barely had time to give him two slaps before the shape escaped into a hole in the ground.
"ah," the young man said to himself, it was just the moles.
- and what fine moles! don't stop loving!
it was then, and a long time after, that the pine forest began to fall on him, as he entered it grabbing the trees and pushing one after the other one after and into the other and pine needles rained down and he said to himself: - don't stop!
he didn't care about pine needles and had never missed their taste on his tongue, pine needles.
pine needles.

TAGLIA

splendid pine needles that impaled themselves on his skin and crucified themselves on his skin and in a circle overlapped on his skin and that now plant themselves on his head and grow very tall, fine, until they touch mars and jupiter and saturn with their white shapes, by the hundreds, aphelic, lesiac, phaledic, ashen, first they rained gently down from the trees, their slender arms twisted on their pockmarked bodies, covered with cuts, with black spots, with bruises not yet cleared, set, cooked and eaten.
pine needles! said the potato-peeler boy
- bring us the heroin, the pine needles said with one voice, falling slowly towards the ocean of plastic bags at their feet - here it is here it is!
shouted the all-happy young man
- give it to us give it to us, they said in a low voice
- here it is here it is!
he shouted again and put a brown bag in his mouth.
and the pine needles circled towards him and when they reached him they began to eat from his mouth the earth that was supposed to be the drug;
in swarms they bent over him, who in the meantime was un-crying: i'm so sorry, these good boys, i really need to understand them.
and they went on for a while, then when the heroin ran out they turned and slipped into the plastic bags, getting smaller and smaller until they were completely hidden.
an ambiguous breeze rose, young dory-wringer wrapped himself tighter in his coat and looked around frightened.
an ambiguous breeze rose and from the plastic bags came hundreds of field mice, one by

TAGLIA

one they entered the mouth of young flintstone - they reached his stomach and there they remained sleeping until today.
next

when he returned home it was always night, and he didn't know where he was nor how to get back.
so he would stop and wait for the streetlights to turn on and after a while the firefly-ants would arrive, who walking and walking would climb up the poles and enter the glass cases and the streetlights would turn on.
and he would get lost and sit on the stones and look around and wait for the sirens' song to orient himself and in the night slowly the bats would arrive and get tangled in the hair of the siren-people who would cut their hair and scream and scream and he would follow them until the last bat had been hanged and the sound then subsided
and he would get lost and not find himself and cry and cry and wait for the tears to reach the ground showing him how much time had passed and he would take heart thinking of the time passed and counting how little was left until dawn and then he would
realize it was day and he was happy and no longer cried and found himself in front of the house and knocked on the door and the old man would open saying:
- and who are you who knocks and knocks at my door!
- and who are you who shouts and shouts as if i were a stranger in my own home!

TAGLIA

- your home!
oh fine!
- what's fine, oh fine?!
- this house is mine and it's fine, fine stranger in my house!
and then mr. pray-flag would grab him and push him away and enter.
and the house slowly became confused because of his decision and from the old man's house it became a fine little house again, with grandma and ma' cooking little frogs and sea urchins.
who knows where that poor evicted old man is now? can you see him from above?
is it him, that old man approaching the high western towers that are slowly collapsing?
is it him, that old man who is at the sea and on the water tries to grasp his own portrait?
is it him, that old man who never stops writing his own name on his own body and on that of the woman he hates?
is it him, that old man who can no longer remember his son's face and yet does nothing but shake his head and laugh at him?
is it him, that old man, or is it me, or you?

and now the sun has risen and every soul has been serene!
- listen to the sound of the miracle!
shouts the little host-stealer from the balcony as he rubs his hands on the railing and strains his eyes to the very end of the horizon.
- i can see you inside your little houses! i know what you're made of

TAGLIA

my dears!
i can hear you talking from here, i can smell your scent! i know what you are thinking, at every moment!
i see your future! i saw you when you committed your first sin, and i will not stop seeing you no matter how much you pray to me!
it is useless for you to continue crowding in dark places to curse me with death, with prayer, with inspired orations!
i know what animates you, i know your purpose. i know who you are! i know!
i see you! damned! saints!
look at me! do not leave me alone! i beg you! i am alone!
i am desperate! and he threw himself on the ground and grabbed the iron of the balcony tighter and bowed his face and lamented:
- if i can i will help you but do not leave me alone, for years now i no longer know where, how, i no longer know for what reason, for what sense, when;
and who was it who said it, who was it who did it, what pushed him and how much.
find any system, come up here and cast me among you... or under you, where the larvae are that feed and mate, in the mire
- ma', ma'.
- what is it little one?
- i'm not little ma', i'm big!
- have you seen those beautiful big whales?
those that go up and down, and don't drown? have you seen how fat and wide and noisy and sloppy they are?
when they were small nobody saw them, now everyone sees them, and you know what happens to them, eh?

then grandma arrives and throws the plate on the table, grabs the meat and slams it in the little master's face.
- we kill them! we strangle them, we cut them, we peel them, we cook them, we eat them!
the poor little master cries and screams, but grandma and mamma continue to laugh and throw whale meat at him.
they pick it up from the ground and squeeze it on his skin. after a few minutes the room is full of blood, meat and scales.
- so? you want to be big? you want to be conspicuous?
- yes ma'! please ma'! i beg you ma'!
and then grandma grabs a large hook and ties it to the nylon and lowers it down his throat while mamma holds him tight and he squeals, mr. gut-hunter, but he's having fun.
and then they cut him into slices, they slam him into the filthy pots, they laugh, they bang on the lids dancing in a circle and shouting this song:
poor, poor us!
that we have a whale-son, and we will eat him, and we will vomit him, and he will go away, and he will forget us!
what have we done? where did we go wrong?
- ma' i beg you! i beg you ma'!
and moved, the old women collect the meat, eat it and vomit it in the toilet, and in the toilet mr. calf-peeler slips and ends up in the mediterranean sea and there he stays, for long years.

so

and so he was covered in entrails in the entrails of the fish that had eaten him, and he grumbled in a low voice at the days, a cow's rib cage got tangled in his hair.
or maybe it was something else entirely.
he couldn't understand what was happening because darkness had fallen and many strange things had already happened to him, so he wasn't very able to distinguish the true from the false, our hero.
our cigarette-lighter.
for example, he had a cut on one hand and could no longer grasp his arms because of the pain, and although he had been repeating the same sentence to himself for more than half an hour, he didn't have a clear idea of its meaning.
- oh look at him! look at him, friend curly! the fish! here it comes! - said mr. thought-crusher.
- but what's in its mouth! what is it!
- come come beautiful big fish!
- it's a child, my god! and that child is me!
- what nonsense are you talking mr. stone-breaker.
- and yet i tell you it is so my friend!
look at me, look at me i no longer have arms, look at me look at me, there is something deep and new and unpleasant in my gaze.
what must i have known! what horrors, and what

TAGLIA

miseries! come here, come here my brother, leave this fish and come here to me.
curly grabbed the fish and slammed it on the hot stones of the dock.
- what are you doing?
i don't understand where we are! the little figure shouted. and then:
- who are you, who are you!
- calm down, said the two.

the hair was very long, it ended underwater and you couldn't see the end of it.
the two boys spent the whole morning pulling it out.
the most incredible thing was the face: it was the spitting image of mr. stormbeard.
while curly and the gentleman cleaned the seaweed from her hair, the little figure of mr. story-singer thanked them politely:
- i can do anything for you, to thank you, to make you understand how grateful i am.
incredible things, incredible things, believe me. i have been in the devil's secret room.
- little figure!
little child, be calm, be quiet! said young silence-breaker as he walked home, hiding his simulacrum in the folds of his coat.
because it was still talking, without respite, for hours now.
- and then in the room there was a wide cave covered with moss, where the deer went to take shelter, on august nights.
and the virgins came out

of the houses made of human flesh and joined them, and did with them unspeakable things!
- and so why do you insist on narrating them to me, oh myself?
- because you must know!
you must know what joys are hidden far from those two old women!
the world is large, and beautiful and rich!
- i don't believe you my brother.
- but how can you?
can't you see, not even at night, when you are alone, and everything is silent, that there is a hidden message, a voice that calls you, at the bottom.
and the wood of living plants? have you never listened to its voice?
it is similar to the bark of a dog if you think about it. but lighter, wider.
it's hard to explain like this, why don't you let me show you..
and he looked for his chin, to caress it.
- be still.
- but you can't go on like this! you'll go mad! and so young too!
it's a shame, you'll agree with me!
- you don't know what you're talking about.
- i have perfectly clear what i'm saying! always! don't make me angry!
- good.

the light passed through the branches and drew arabesques on the white and round stones that were chained to one another on the course of the azaleas, before arriving at viale dei platani, to the right of via degli obelischi, between the piazza degli eucalipti and the mount of the orphans, behind the rich quarter and that boundless circle of flowers that is my haha, buried in the exact center of corso vittoria, three steps from via dei bambini, from the gate of vicolo bianco, from the bells of the cathedral, in the exact point where the light hits the shoes of the gentleman who struggles towards home.
and he rests his hands on the door and lets them slide downwards, caressing it, his nostrils full of the smell of fresh paint, his body immersed in sweat and all the spirits that possess him dominate in the sky and in the boundless universe.
- mamma mamma open up open up help help!
somewhere behind him there is someone howling his name, a voice that echoes through the walls chasing him like a ghost.
TAGLIA

the mother opens the door for him and he plummets inside like a little fish in a plastic bag of water at the amusement park, just before the other child on the bicycle arrives.
- open up open up!

- i'm a friend of mr. crowstorm, i have to beat him up i have to beat him up!
- and why?
no no go away go away shoo!

- alright alright, come in!
and from afar the gentleman tries to stop her:
- no, mamma no!
and curly falls into the house, sending the ornaments and jade statuettes with the god ming drawn on them flying, and all the cats run out from under the sofas out of the windows, smashing them, they launch themselves into the air:
- come here, come here, where are you running off to i have to beat you up i have to beat you up!
- no no no no!
the young fresh-thistle is grabbed by an ankle and rolling, kicking and spitting down the stairs, down billions of steps, for a good six hours until they fall into the sewer and into the smelly water.
curly grabs him and tries to strangle him but mr. young-thistle slips away like the eel he is and slips into a hole in the wall, but curly like

but in nothing a lot of things happen, like for example a christmas party with all the parts reversed and the children are a grotesque gift for a decor consisting solely of toys (to be continued).
it seems to me
in a box that looks like a room there are round windows and inside the children's toys with their toy beds, their toy dogs, their toy closets, their toy power outlets, above the house are mr. toasttomomma with miss redface who

TAGLIA

pass each other scalpels and masks and stick their hands in the middle of the toys as if they didn't know perfectly well that they will have to get old, and older and older until they die, in fear and sickness.
and knowing it perfectly, with the serious face of death they pass lives to each other and place them in the little room in the box in the big ugly building like a christmas surprise, there are forty children playing with a room in a box at christmas and there is none of them who knows that i exist and i watch them from behind the glass, but you know very well who i am, i am mr. fresh-find!
that now i go solitary out of this hallucination and i am alone on the wet grass until i find the well.
what i call the well and what the gentleman immediately calls the well is an opening in the lawn in front of the house with a porthole, inside you can glimpse a room but the gentleman doesn't know for sure and has never gone down there.
and here is mr. young-broken who opens the well and goes inside, what will he ever find?
and why does he go down there? head down, a few centimeters at a time, suspended in the air, he goes down, yeah!
he goes down.
here is the list of objects that mr. geckocat will bring with him into the well:
a pair of pliers, on the handle it's written: for left-handers only, and mr. shirt-fucker from the first moment he read that writing was very

TAGLIA

disappointed, because he is not left-handed and doesn't know what to do with a pair of pliers for left-handers, he could very well leave it alone but he doesn't want to and tries anyway to grab it and pinch his nose, so he pinches his nose and pulls but can't pull anything off and complains dismayed, and then throws the pliers away in a corner, laughs at it,
yells at it until his heart explodes in his chest, sings it a song, kneels down, begs it, crawling he approaches it, caresses it, coaxes it, kisses it, grabs it and in a flash eats it then nothing else.
oh here instead, something else!
in the well there is a little old man who hits his stick against the lenses of his glasses, but the lenses are unbreakable, incredible, impassive!
and yet they break, with a grandiose noise! incredible!
and the old man out of joy does a little dance, takes off his top hat and sticks inside a handful of crickets that fall from the ceiling, then looks carefully at mr. come-from-the-other and puffs right in his nose:
- what did you come here for!
- i have nothing to do, i don't know how to do anything!
- well what do you want? whaddayawant?
- i want to go on but where do i go if i don't know how to do anything?
- i don't know, it's not important you fucking youth!

- but i must learn to do something oh you drooling piece of shit old man!
- cocksucker pervert busted belly i'll suck your intestine and lick your liver.
- i'll detach your bones and piss on your suit, oh, i've got it! i've understood!
- what? what?
asked young fresh-news
- we must go on anyway, you understand and we will go on!
and he started singing this cheerful but allergic to grapes, to breadcrumbs and to sesame bread song:
- we must go on, like the black tide through the ships and breaking the rocks.
even if we have already smashed the hull, and if we have forgotten we must start all over again.
we must go on, one foot after the other until we never stop again.
or we must go on with our shoulders, breaking the backs of the attendants in the post offices.
or we must go on like a black tide drowning the mind, suffocating the thoughts, the ideas, the dreams, until we emerge from the skull and rise like a gray smoke through the ceiling and into the sky among the puffs of birds in heat and the deafening demands of children forgotten even by the devil.
until we are one and black around the whole world, until we are invincible.
he threw his hat on the ground, pulled out a guitar and launched into a completely ridiculous solo.
TAGLIA

it was there that young swarm-scratcher had his first flash. a kind of dementia had taken possession of him.
some spirited demon had slipped between the folds of his coat to make a nest and from there direct armies capable of slaughtering each other on their own in the world.
the world that is not seen anywhere, the world that surely uhm.
but that in any case resists the positions taken by the very young autumn boar, his own body out of the well, with his face on the wet lawn, suddenly there is a little girl in front of him.
- i spoke with a guy who revealed to me all the power of demons!
young daredevil shouldn't have but immediately after he started tearing his hair out in front of the little girl, who was very frightened and rightly went to call her mother, her father, her grandmother her grandfather the waiters and then the policeman the dog and the underworld.
but it was the negroes who struck more terror into the young gentleman than any other creature.
the frightening beasts with a single eye on their feathered chest, who come galloping and hurling their spears against anyone, defeating all resistance and erasing every trace of themselves from their path.
one hundred, one hundred and twenty thousand negroes in a daring march who smash the gate, win against the guards and in front of the young hasty-counsel and his intention to slice all things they reprimand him:
- well, stay calm, huh?
well! well! ah! ah!

and they leave, the young man can only shake his head and get angry

TAGLIA

with the little girl who snitched, wringing her neck and putting her in the cemetery with the other chickens.
the young girl would be resurrected only a month later for the stylistic needs of her grandfather who needed her to furnish the attic where he was holed up.
- who gives a fuck anyway! shouted the little girl, in a man's voice.
- the problem is that we haven't seen a pussy around here for years!
"when?"
young orange-stainer asked himself, banging his knee on the manhole cover of the well.
- you could catch some, look, look, there it is there it is, we hadn't seen them for years!
and these pussies with white and hairy wings circled in swarms, grazing the grass, pissing and spitting broken fragments of mussels from their orifice.
- catch it, catch one! and young stick-thorn dived in flight and grabbed a pair, squeezed them very very tight until the juice came out and then raised his arms triumphantly looking around, but there was no one left and he felt rather stupid.
so he put the bicycle away in the garage that by the way he didn't have and went home.
he always went to the kitchen to collect the knives from the drawers and back in the living room he would do the knife throw against the paintings of horses.
there were all these paintings with these horses that passed from one painting to another as if in a carousel and he always missed them, but the paintings were

TAGLIA

all riddled with holes and it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish the horses.
and from the holes the heads would poke out, sometimes, of some other dried-up animal, but only sometimes.
most of the time they remained just holes. it's not like something necessarily has to happen to a hole, a hole stays there and minds its own fucking business, curly always said, and he must have known something about it.
old mr. lament-melter remembers well and with crackling nostalgia when he and curly were in the brick basin in front of his house and they would flip through pornographic magazines, cutting out the sexual organs to make origami.
- now i'm angry!
- now i'm sad!
- now i'm depressed, depressed, depressed, i want to die!
- now i'm brave, i'll make it!
- now i'm depressed, depressed!
- now i'm fine, i'm cheerful, i laugh, i joke!
- now i'm paranoid, i have high blood pressure!
- i'm too intelligent, i make funny faces!
- now i'm sad, i'm weak, i'm petty!
- now i don't count for a shit, now i count for nothing!
- now i look around and i don't understand what's happening! but the only thing i always have is this terror.

said old mr. kidney-breaker to young frog-boar. "i can only define myself in this fear," the young man said to himself.
and in fact young duckling had fear to spare!
glancing at his hand gripping the desk and balling up his legs between the thighs of a teacher in the village's nursery school and he couldn't sleep, with his skull stuck in the wood of the desk.
the whites of his eyes dripped onto the wood and he was terrified that they would make too much noise dripping on the floor.
and as soon as someone heard him: a lightning bolt would explode on the windowpane and from an adjacent corridor someone would shout:
- it's carnival!
dress up, dress up as devils and come here to die of terminal illnesses!
then

and so young autumn-spit despaired to collect his eyes from the floor and he never succeeded because some other child or some other cockroach always came to lick them first.
and they would take him by the arms and make him discover what it meant to be taken by the arms, "nothing special nothing special" he would say nervously to the ceiling.
and they would carry him along up these stone stairs painted white through these fumes illuminated only by the combustion lamps

TAGLIA

stuck in the floor.

and they would turn him over and over like an octopus and he was afraid, the young dirty-one!
and he would pull his underwear out of his pants and throw it out the windows, where no one could see it!
and instead everyone saw it and brought it inside in a procession and forced him to recognize it as his, and then they would vote on whether it was necessary to continue to keep him with them, and the votes always ended in a tie, or the proportion was always oblique and then they would start all over again until the young man gave up and accepted what he was:
an animal!
and so take him and roast him and throw him in the dining hall!
and he instead, being a clever one, as soon as they looked away, would sit down like a mr. witch-haste and when it was time to eat he wouldn't take anything they gave him, and he would look at the others and mock them for this weakness.
and he would eat what his grandma and ma' had prepared for him and after every bite he would vomit.
the others instead, from eating the administrative slop, would die, the very next day, or thereabouts, he would say and irritate them and they felt foolish.
why don't you stay here until four in the morning, a little girl asked him.
and he stayed stayed secretly until ten to three but then he went where all the stars go when the sky ends, that is, nowhere.
and she came to him anyway and opened his mouth, sentencing:

TAGLIA

- my god!
- you only have four teeth, and there are six hornets with burnt wings mating with fish bones, and a tree is growing on your palate, and from the branches of the tree little pieces of meat are falling onto tiny mouths (which are not real, but only drawn) at the back of your tongue!
- oh my god, my god! kill them, kill them all! is it dangerous?
and the red-haired little girl made her most contrite expression and squeezed with difficulty into his mouth and tried to fight against the hornets, who however pierced her with their sharp lances and hanged her from the tree.
and lumpy spiders came from the back of the tongue and chopped her up, and her flesh fell in pieces from her body and went to lodge between the gentleman's gums.
and what was left of her still alive from the noose said:
- you are not the reason why this world is suffering.
you are not the reason why this world is happy. you are not the reason for anything.
"i know a thing or two about nothing" thought young paper-wasp, but his mind was full of food and nothing was understood.
TAGLIA

the mother and the grandmother were embracing in the big bed and massaging each other's belly.
young paperweight was refreshing their faces with lemon juice, and suddenly he bent over his mother's ear.
- i hear someone complaining from the room below, should i go see?
- be still, i'm sick, i'm sick i'm sick!
ma' shouted.
- but it could be serious, don't you hear?
- i'm going to see.
he poured the rest of the lemon on the foreheads of the two old women and searched the floor, until he found the trapdoor and the path covered with algae that led to the sewers.
at the bottom was curly scratching his belly.

- the cesspool! what do you think of it?
- asked curly
- it stinks of shit! - he insisted
- there's someone here who was meowing - retorted the young veracruso
- and what do you care!
- i care about friends!
- and are you a friend?

TAGLIA

- am i not a friend?
- yeah right
- well then i want to be a friend! i want to be one!
- yeah right
- i have the strength i have the courage i feel a great energy inside me!
- he said all in one breath.
- you only know one thing: your damned soul and that of your dead, you don't give a damn about the rest, but nothing!
- with this nothing again, enough, look how much stuff, look! and he pointed to the crap, picked it up and threw it at him.
- but this, this is nothing.
- look, look, look how much stuff! and he pushed him into the crap.
- but it's nothing, this is nothing.
- look how much stuff, look how much! until he suffocated him.
but curly got annoyed and left, and from then on they were never friends again.
and so, left alone, he tried to climb back up.
- i'm dying, i'm sick i have stones in my colon!
shouted mamma and grandma together from above.

the young lightbulb-changer found climbing up the corridor as difficult as it had been easy to go down, and so after falling two, three times, he gave up and set off along the sewer path,

TAGLIA

following the lament.
along the way, he found:

a chapel and inside it an invaluable painting by caravaggio, illuminated by two life-sized madonnas holding a lamp, when young field-crawler passed in front of them only one of them turned her head towards him and said nothing.
grates, and from the grates dwarves who stuck out their eyes to silently despise him and the caravaggio.
an old friend of his whom he thought was dead and instead now lived there, with a wife and children.
but no trace of the lament, until he stopped to look at his own reflection in the piss and saw a swelling at the height of his belly.
he wrung out his shirt and between the blood and a tuft of hair the simulacrum of himself that he had fished from the sea a few years before fell to the ground, by now forgotten, by now dead.
it was very uncomfortable and terrible, and so he decided to give up and walk away from there, alone and without a destination, and this is material that does not concern us as far as this text is concerned.

after about ten years he gave up and tried to find the way back to the village but after a few steps he was picked up by a state agency and thrown into a workplace.

PART TWO

THE TRANQUILITY OF THE BARBARIAN

returning from the workplace he throws himself wretchedly on the carpet.
with his hands he collects the doping substances from the bowls and spreads them on his face, even though they no longer have any effect on him, he can't do without them.
for goodness' sake, even if a millennium has passed, in his mind he feels as he once did.
as for the synapses there is just something like an echo.
to explain myself better or worse: when he tries to make a running start in the cavern of mathematical imagination a referee blows his whistle and shows him the lap time, and says:

- it is clear that there are the same seconds as when you were a young man, there are no doubts about the centimeters, we agree on the grammage and the pawn is out of danger.
however i am furrowed by that sound we heard, such an echo is not

TAGLIA

explainable except with some problem of a space-time nature, are you familiar with sci-fi stuff?
- surely.
- then let's drop it because i detest them.
eat more red meat and it will be worse next year.
but mr. fish-turner was by now wise and avoided the mandatory intelligence tests, using a whole series of increasingly grotesque excuses.
his colleagues had learned to detest him deeply.
every time he walked away to clean the bodies he heard them speak ill of him, and he regretted it.
their job wasn't fantastic, but what job is?
it was mainly about collecting the bodies at the junkyard, dividing them, seeing if there's anything inside, washing/closing them and trying to sell the shell.
at the end of the year the best seller was without any particular proclamation demoted to collection, for practical marketing reasons.
but due to company policy, whoever found something inside that reminded them of an affection could decide whether to keep it for themselves or even

TAGLIA

eat it directly.
mr. always-lamps was constantly distracted at work, but they couldn't fire him because he was the only one able to find the bodies.
before his hiring the workplace was bare, the colleagues wandered nervously around the white marble table, questioning each other in an attempt to understand where to find the bodies.
nothing was more important to be able to do this job. however there were no bodies or they had already been taken, or something was never right and they were not entirely in agreement on what to do.
as soon as he was hired mr. cherry-taker involuntarily found a body at the junkyard and from there he began to take care of a bit of everything.
the price to pay for living is high but since he was almost always at the workplace the guards never found him, so he had been living there for many years without paying the full price.
EH

he almost no longer thinks about the village. the first few years before sleeping he would spend at least an hour repeating to himself all the events of his life to confirm their importance.
for a long

TAGLIA

period he still had a fairly clear idea of the whole path that had brought him there, but for at least a few years he had discovered this ability to distract himself thanks to technology that allowed him to Completely Fuck the System.
the technology was this:
near the bed he kept a gramophone, with seven different protuberances.
if he squeezed them he could enter directly into contact with seven different alien entities from dimensional planes so improbable as to make this heap of words seem like a single letter.
i mean precisely such a distance in the ability to react to symbols and to provoke them that the gentleman often in fact understood something completely different from what the entities tried to say or do to him, but he was satisfied anyway.
after a hard day at the workplace he could serenely observe as his own identity was crumbled by pandimensional creatures, only to find himself impossibly whole a new day.
and he dreamed and ate and woke up and slept strange dreams again, for a long time.
and for a long time he had to do with these protuberances, with a vague idea of a Project that would serve to Fuck the System.

he was so dedicated to this elusive purpose that the days were a confused thing and they dismantled around him like the outlines of things and events dismantle when you are in the tranquility of the barbarian, it rarely happened that he found himself in the coherent flow of the world, and he was almost disappointed when it happened.
he spends too much time with substances and technology, all his neighbors and a large part of the entities themselves grumbled, but he seemed happy like that.
he was often so distracted that he didn't notice incredible deals happening around him, such as the whole affair of the parrot, the neighbor's house on fire and the enormous flood apparently fallen from nowhere/trademark, the facts, in short, of day 14.

TAGLIA

summary recap
of the incredible events of day 14

i don't remember, i wasn't there, i didn't witness it.
TAGLIA

now ok, all light stuff although:

the pain of one person is the same as every other person.
every single person comes before every single civilization.

every hallucination in every single person comes before every single person.
a unicellular organism when it dies should give you the same sadness as a single person, and much more than any single civilization.
when our civilization collapses will you feel sadness?

only you will survive our civilization, you will stand on a rock and from above you should shoot fireworks and eat popcorn.
don't be offended if i address you as if you were another person.
i was upset when you went straight on pretending not to know me and for your oppressive REDACTED.
TAGLIA

as happens to everyone however, one day he realized he was working with colleagues.
the first day of work of the male colleague was confused with another.
the first day of work of the female colleague they brushed hands by mistake while trying to grab a carcass, and they had the same breath and immediately a gush of mucus came out of his nose which incinerated the female colleague.
subsequently he discovered that the colleagues and he had nothing in common.
at night, back home, he squeezed the protuberances with more force, trying to distract himself from the oppressive hard work, just now that he had almost managed to completely forget everything, just now that he was getting so close to these fantastic pandimensional beings.
he told himself he had to do something and that the only solution was to bring the world of the pandimensional beings deeper into his reality, so he plucked up the courage and invited his colleagues to a post-satanic initiation rite in the room next door.
the female colleague refused immediately but mr. fresh-roast gave her a slap and dragged her by the hair until she consented.
TAGLIA

these were the ways in use at the time and we cannot in any way judge the colleague's refusal.
if today no one refuses anything anymore it is thanks to the efforts of female and male colleagues who had the courage to say yes when it seemed impossible, and had the strength to surrender to the ineluctable.
in the post-satanic rite, people are seated inside small ditches in the ground, in the desert, among the fumes, in the room next to the workplace.
they suddenly come out of the ditches in the ground and look around, they no longer know what their names are or how they got there.
- has someone drugged us?
- who am i? who are we?
someone says, but for the most part they just crawl out of the hole in silence.
mr. hmhm stays in the hole looking at the sky above, and admires for several nights and days the spectacle of the stars and the shades and the chromatic power of the fundamental colors.
TAGLIA

if a small animal approaches him, he is not frightened, he eats it in one bite.
if it rains, he blinks his eyes faster and the raindrops are swept away by his eyelids in all directions, drawing shapes in the air that the gentleman immediately recognizes as historical facts of his life and of all the others.
meanwhile the colleague from the next hole tells him that he has broken an arm and is probably dead.
when he finally decides to get out of his hole in the desert his body has by now completely atrophied and he can no longer move it.
then the female colleague appears from above who, laughing, sticks a hooked spear into his body and pulls him up.
she will drag him laughing towards a city of high towers, in the cavernous city where the post-satanic rite will be held.
the blood behind mr. uglyface draws a picture of amateur quality by mixing earth and garbage, the gentleman will try to improve the situation by lazily moving his leg and foot to draw a more aesthetically relevant line, but the female colleague will make fun of his attempts,

TAGLIA

with cruelty:

- i will do this in the future, i will be this in the future, while you will still be here fumbling with blood and trash.
unfortunately the gentleman had no way of seeing the city approaching him, as this was happening, but dragged by the working spirit the city opened up around him slowly like a memory of the past, inside a dream.
the beasts roam near the large arched gate, but they are so thin that they don't even have the strength to attack prey, and they whine and look at the gentleman and the colleague with small sad eyes.
naked children run around, throwing stones at the beasts.
round openings in the tuff seem like houses or shops or entrances to the hive, the gentleman does not concern himself with these things, the colleague is too busy dragging him to care about the morphology of the world in post-satanism.
and finally they arrive at the place of the ritual.

TAGLIA

in the exact center of the city there is a trapdoor and under the trapdoor a ladder.
the female colleague throws the gentleman into the darkness of the trapdoor and calmly descends the ladder.
at the bottom there is a black river of sewage flowing and walkways full of rats.
the female colleague picks up the half-drowned gentleman by hitting him again with the hooked spear and placing him precisely on the rats.
the rats however instead of dragging the gentleman to the place of the ritual try to eat him, and so the female colleague curses and shoos them away and resumes dragging the little master manually.
there is another ladder that leads up to a high tower and then to a large hall and then after a sharp turn another ladder and another hall, the superficial furnishing is drawn by a divine hand a few seconds before the colleagues reach the predetermined points, otherwise there was nothing there,

TAGLIA

only one person will meet them along the journey and give them a summary blessing, and finally through a trapdoor the gentleman is thrown into the place of the ritual, which is a place completely immersed in darkness.
there he finds his male colleague, who strangely is not dead and strangely has the same face as the female colleague and also has the same face as him.
- here, in the deep water.
- yes?
- if we have the courage to die.
(repeat)
- if we have the courage to die.
- we can be reborn with the ancient knowledge, which illuminates the future.
- the future.
- and transforms what is liquid into gel.
- and kills the insects when they are too close.
- take my hand.

TAGLIA

the gentleman in a state of semi-consciousness due to the lost blood tries to grab the female colleague's hand but makes a mistake and finds her neck.
the female colleague smiles in the dark and bites his hand.
the gentleman tries to free himself but the female colleague has now decided to sacrifice herself for him and begins to eat his hand.
the gentleman cries, but in the dark water the tears are as invisible as they are devoid of a true form, as if they had always been part of the water.
- this was not what i wanted. this was not what i hoped for.
says the female colleague, crying too, and suddenly they find themselves in a white light and completely formless.
TAGLIA

- here we are again, in this analytical and more refined expression of resistance and existence, towards the one and only, start over.
-

said the monkey as it dictated to its own anthropomorphic arm, called by itself millions of years ago with a name still forgotten.
the monkey is inside a white egg and its anthropomorphic arm draws childish portraits of the gentleman and the female colleague on the surface of the egg, ignoring the death rattles of its own mind.
- so very quickly the ritual presupposes organic repetition through a collective hallucination and it is from this very collectivity that the gentleman emerges.
not so much as a presence or an absence, but as a necessity.

the egg opens with the sound of crumpled paper;
a ton of amniotic fluid pours into the decorated room 7, from the monkey's mouth hands appear and then hair and finally the gentleman the male colleague and the female colleague come out, with their faces burned by radiation.
TAGLIA

they have different ages and different faces but they are indisputably them, they fall asleep peacefully on the carpet a short distance from each other.
after about half an hour the female colleague gets up and goes home, ignoring the scene around her.
the male colleague doesn't get up anymore, then instead he gets up.
mr. littlegates will do the same half an hour later still.
afterwards

to get home from work the gentleman every day, would get on the boat, grumbling against the government, while massaging his wide face and clinging to the main mast, in the midst of all the others, without even stopping his grumbling for a second.
the other travelers had learned to detest him, for his sloppy movements, the various filth that dripped from his pockets, and the never-corrected habit of talking about himself in the fourth person.
TAGLIA

- one day someone will come and manage to strangle mr. stormpredator. - someone always said and rightly so.
someone instead remained near the gentleman and hugged him, and they remained embraced until the boat reached the pier and then they would leave, shaking hands with vigorous jolts.
arriving home, the gentleman would let out a faint breath, and a small piece of paper would come out of his mouth, and on the paper, noted in pen, a brief comment on the events of his day.
he would place his coat on a coat rack and immediately slip into the technology.
the technology was a tub with a kind of gramophone and from the gramophone came out now putrid protuberances, half-alive, if they ever had been, blackened and worn out from use.
the gentleman squeezed the protuberances, and in the putrid smell he could hear echoes of thoughts not his own.
this happened every day, for years now, for all the time the gentleman was not working.
from the outside one could see nothing but the tub, the gramophone, and the gentleman with his coat on.
(there had never been any coat rack.)

TAGLIA

when the gentleman came out of the tub he remembered absolutely nothing of what he had experienced during the tub, except for the first few minutes and for a subsequent evidence, here in the meantime however is the punctual account of the first minutes:

there is a pier, and on the edge of the pier, on the lake, there is a cat.
the cat immediately melts into a red puddle, and the gentleman notices he has a fishing rod in his hand and that he is pulling something out of the puddle, the objects he finds are usually of no importance, mostly garbage or stones, but at a certain point he always finds a note on the hook, and on the note, jotted down in pen, a brief comment on his following day.
he reads it, laughs and tries to remember it, but then he loses all memory.
every time the little master awakens from the experiences with the pandimensional entities, the first thing he does is pull off a small piece of meat from the gramophone with a knife and chew it with a doubtful air.
on that particular day, immediately after, he spits on the ground, and from the shape of the spit on the ground he intuits what will happen in his day or tries to imagine it.
TAGLIA

every time after this moment of reflection on various messages and on life the gentleman loved to re-immerse himself in the tub and replicate the experience, if he could, or go to work, if he was too afraid of being fired.
on that particular day the gentleman decided he could afford to stay and re-enter the tub directly.
once inside, he quickly found the remote control and set a shot for half an hour later.
the dialogue with the female colleague:

- some things are just the way they are.
let's talk for example about the game of chess, for several pages.
- no, but why...
- because no matter how much you may rave in these paranormal abysses, there are objective things.
first of all there is time..
- but what does that have to do..
- it has everything to do with it! and then there is the opponent, and then there is your king, and then there are multiplications and complications of the same identical thing.
but the truth is that if you are not aware of these things you cannot think of understanding anything about anything..

TAGLIA

- but what?
- there are these things, in general: time, the opponent, you.
if you forget about the first two things the third gets beheaded..
- and so?
then you start over, you switch colors, right?
- playing with black is different from playing with white.
it's how demons from the lower dimensions play..
- i thought you were against paranormal abysses...
- if you played with black, any demon could behead you in a few moments.
- but why this fixation on beheading?
- that's how you kill each other in reality, among millenary beings.
like the movie highlander, it's all true.
- but that's absurd..
- it's the only way.
in any case, where did you get that?
the female colleague pointed with a professional air at the small calf in the handbag on the table.
- i found it like this. it was like this when i got the house.
- see for example you shouldn't trust these things so easily, it could be a fork.
- a fork?
TAGLIA

- in the chess sense, it could be threatening a fork right now, to be exact.
- huh?
- there are beings that, if you're not careful, look like other beings and slip into people's houses to spy on them, and they are simultaneously attacking your various aspects, at least two, and someone will be taken, maybe someone will fall for it...
- but always the demons?
- no no, these are other things, other things..
the female colleague or the male colleague, in the meantime, was feeling the calf;
after a few seconds the skin began to wrinkle under his touch and fall off like thin sheets.
then the calf itself dissolved into a gray slime, smearing the handbag and the colleague.
- no no, you see, in this case it's not a problem, probably because you castled!
- in what sense?
- this type of creature is harmless when your king is safe and you have connected the rooks...
- what rooks?
- the two rooks are a complication of your king, or rather, of your king and your queen...
- like children?
- vaguely yes, or friends, what do i know, all the other pieces are

TAGLIA

complications and divisions of your king, which is the only thing that really exists on your side of the board...
- so what's the point of talking about the other pieces?
what sense would they have?
- imagine it like this: the moment your king has to attack the enemy king, every move he makes within the game of chess is slowed down and divided to allow each player to use, at a speed understandable to the mind, all the movements that the chessboard, or reality, allows.
the rooks are an aspect of the king, extremely powerful when they connect, and more powerful on the edges and on defense.
for example, when highlander is attacked in that way in the parking lot in the first film, it's because he hadn't castled, and the guy immediately had a chance to try an attack known as "pulverized liver"...
- why this obsession with highlander?
- because i told you, it's peculiar that the assumption is correct that there are people who live forever, and that the only way to kill them is for another highlander to cut off their head.
- i don't think they were all highlanders, that one was called highlander because he came from...
- it doesn't matter, since then among us we all call ourselves highlander anyway.
as soon as the movie came out it became a trend among us.
- but how many of you are there?
TAGLIA

- how many of us are there... how many of us are there... here i'm clearly talking to myself.
- so what should we do?
- in theory we should behead all the demons, but first you have to learn the game of chess, as i was telling you.
another concept to keep in mind, one of the fundamental ones, is that one must move in a harmonious as well as logical manner.
the fact that things are ordered in reality should make you understand that there are points where certain pieces are stronger;
there are certain squares where you must be with a certain piece or that you must in any case take into consideration.
for example, highlander the series, if i'm not mistaken, there was the one with the long tail;
was it a harmonious continuation, in your opinion?
- i wouldn't know..
- another thing is the fact of playing actively against the opponent.
for example, now i've asked you this question; the fact that you have no answer means that you will be in a land you don't know, on which you find fewer patterns, a land unknown to you, and that although perhaps unknown to me too, at least gives me the certainty of playing on equal terms and that the better player wins.
are you following me? i can't know.
- good, good.
- so if we are still in a situation where your king is alive, we are in the middlegame, in which, besides the fact of

TAGLIA

"playing the position" in which we find ourselves, the possibility of further tricks and complications counts, and you will have to anticipate the tricks and imagine what kind of trick you would do in my place and go on, just as sean connery did who was exceptional in the middle game.
- alright.
- if you are ahead, simplify and maintain the advantage.
you get to the end when all the women die.
- uh.
- the woman is the first complication of the man, from the man's point of view, and the opposite from the woman's point of view.
- ok.
- the woman is only in the future because the origin, contrary to what is believed, is masculine, and the man is only in the past because the future exists solely in its feminine aspect.
you can reverse this thing but it's the same.
- ok..?
- to make it quicker, from your point of view, we can say that the woman represents the maximum power of creation, the clearest image of the creator is feminine, and above every human being there is a woman, both ideal and real.
- it seems a bit..
- in chess this piece is obviously the most important piece and is the main weapon of your king and your only hope of finishing a game quickly;
TAGLIA

however, often the woman dies tragically or in an exchange, as you can imagine... and when the women are no longer present we have entered the endgame.
remember anyway that it's all bullshit, they are all complications.
- uh.
- we haven't talked about the pawns, my and therefore your favorite complication;
pawns can become anything if they reach the end of the board, except obviously the king.
there can be no other king because all these things we have already said, even the queen, remember?
in reality they have no real importance, they are just complications.
- just complications.
- there's only you, or me, the opponent and time.
- why do you say they are our favorite complication?
- they give you a sense of solidity, right? of an army, of justice, of order, of sacrifice, all those things that are a bit right-wing, right?
like highlander?
- is highlander a bit right-wing?
- well...
- ok.
- anyway i think i've concluded: basically you have to understand that this is a game based on time;
there's an opponent and there's you. you play with white even if from the way you play it seems you're with black.
- why do you say that?

TAGLIA

- ok, you castled; ok, you have a fortress;
ok, you should have a draw, but why did you choose white if you want to play like that?
- i don't remember giving you that much familiarity for such a statement..
- it's just for the metaphor, just for the metaphor... anyway you have to understand that, even if it's a draw, for a few seconds you have to die.
- eh?
- the whole system is anyway based on the equivalent of an AI like stockfish, and the scenario responds based on your inputs;
the form is the same, i repeat, of a game of chess and often of highlander.
at the end of a clash, in case of a tie, you continue by swapping colors.
the problem is that you, right now, are too... too... trampled to think you can recover the situation later with black... if you want to think you can do something you should do it now.
you are anyway ahead in material, why don't you even try to attack?
- but i don't know what you're talking about.. who should i attack?
- the enemy king, the opponent... you really don't see him?
know that he sees you very well. the fact that you move the pieces on the board from memory and have managed to survive until now doesn't mean that he isn't there waiting for any mistake of yours to behead you.
- but how do i attack something i don't see?

TAGLIA

in a game i don't understand i'm playing?
in which i don't believe i'm playing?
- only three things exist: time, you and the opponent.
- so you're telling me that the rest of the world is the opponent?
- not exactly, it depends on what you mean by "rest of the world".
there are your pieces, that's for sure, you wouldn't want to give them to the enemy... but apart from those and apart from the chessboard, which despite your various attempts i assure you is impossible to destroy, yes, all the rest of the world is the opponent or part of it.
all the rest of the world, technically, does not exist as you understand it.
- but this is an inhuman, horrible conception, this is worse than solipsism...
- and yet it is reality.
- and all those people in the world...
- they do not exist as you believe them to be... they are a piece of yours or the opponent's, they are the chessboard, or time if you prefer, or at least that's how it is when the game begins... by now however the game is almost over, so the situation on the chessboard can be completely different.
if you want i can tell you how you're doing. do you have tarot cards?
- yes, i think so..
the gentleman got out of the tub and began to rummage in the protuberances until he pulled out a deck of cards stained with green liquid.
he immediately got back into the tub

TAGLIA

diving in like a dead weight.
- here.
- how badly you keep them, wait.
the female colleague pulled a cloth from her hair and began to clean the cards, staring the gentleman in the eyes as she did so.
- supernatural things don't exist and are ridiculous. you told me you can control rain and lightning and you threw a lightning bolt, bravo.
you think you scared me? now no one feels the lightning and no one believes you.
i remind you that without me you wouldn't even know you were playing, you probably wouldn't even exist, for all i know.
- now i don't follow you anymore, i thought you wanted to read my tarot cards.
- yeah, but if i'm not one of your pieces, then who am i?
- are you the opponent?
- and only the opponent can read your tarot cards? then here it is: the first card is the lovers, the second a ten of cups and the third, the queen of swords, also known by me as 'the queen and that's it'.
- and what does that mean?
- the first card is the past, the lovers... it means that in the past you had balance, no shit sherlock, you didn't even exist!
- thanks.
- the second card, the present, a ten of cups... you have to talk to people, be with people, or if you stay here in the tub the demon will find you and behead you.
TAGLIA

- and the third?
- the third card is obviously me. look, it looks like me!
the female colleague showed the card to the gentleman, it depicted a woman on a throne, with a sword in one hand and the palm of the other turned upwards.
- this concludes our analysis of chess for today.
i'm tired, i need to smoke and then i just remembered...
- what?
- that time you went straight on when we had seen each other, all the times you pretended not to know me, all the times... do you think someone will applaud you one day for how good you are at harming me?
because it doesn't work like that. i am the queen of swords... the queen and that's it, do you understand?
i've been with you every moment for at least twenty years without you paying attention to me, and you think i can waste my time every day to stay here and talk to you?
- but how am i harming you i don't understand... or how have i ever harmed you in these twenty years...
- because you never confront me, i can offer you clarity!
- zero clarity so far...
- ah! i don't think anyone has ever spoken so many truths in your game before this moment... all at once too... apart from highlander obviously.
- uhm.
- as i was saying, let's wrap it up here.
the swords lady opened her jacket, spread it on the floor.
the jacket suddenly is a chessboard; the male colleague comes out of it

TAGLIA

straddling a piece.
the chessboard dismantles into a kind of black pool on the floor.
- en passant.
said the lady and she too entered the black pool.
the gentleman, who had nothing better to do, followed her.
en croissant

the gentleman and the lady are in a dark and dense water but the dense and the dark alternate with points where the water is suddenly transparent and with white air bubbles, we observe them inside the frame of an aquarium, from the comfort of the living room sofa, and even if we can't hear what they say, texts appear immediately below the aquarium.
conveniently they describe their dialogue to us, as they float in the alien amniotic substance, illuminated by the spotlights of pure technology of our real apartment,

TAGLIA

because the imaginary one is the one you are in.
- we find ourselves here as i told you, following the logic of the world that i explained to you, because all your supernatural bullshit doesn't explain this... this... this practical ineluctable practical destiny, you understand?
this flowing, and the opponent, and you...
- i don't understand...
- there is only you, the opponent and time, i am your best piece and you must use me to the best of your ability.
- i thought you were the opponent?
- nah, i was kidding you, do i look like the opponent? i'm the lady! i bring you clarity and truth!
- i don't understand.
- i explained the rules of the game to you! who else explained them to you, so far?
- but what does that have to do with it, what does it have to do with all this?
mr. littlebirds waved his fists in the water to metaphorically indicate the entirety of the experience.
- this?
this is the chessboard, i can't believe you're still in this state. here, wait...
the lady swam closer to the gentleman;
her dress billowed, making her look like a jellyfish.
slyly and without any warning she stuck an arm in his mouth and pulled out from his stomach a small book, all dirty and wrinkled, on the cover only the words: 'BUS PLAYER'.
TAGLIA

- see? this.
- what is this?
- you have to wake up early one morning, get on the bus, look around and go to the first person with an interesting face and ask them if they can read.
- ok....?
- you then thank them and leave them the book, if they tell you they have no money or are not interested you just tell them you wrote it, after which you immediately get off the bus or move away and get off without saying your name and on the book your name is not written, but it would be even cooler if you got off immediately, so maybe you have to manage the timing well...
- but why, why do i have to do this?
- why? do you want to eat it again? look, how disgusting!
in the meantime the lady was trying to clean the book with her hair, obtaining questionable results.
- the person who receives this book from you will have a destiny graced by the gods, and you too for every time you give this book to someone will receive in gift a graced destiny, from the gods.
- but what does all this have to do with the chessboard, the king, the opponent...
- it has to do with it, because the first thing is the rules of the game.
so, time, the king and the opponent. all the rest are inventions and complications, so let's dissolve the complications: you, as long as you live, are your king.
TAGLIA

as long as you can live, you have to move on the chessboard, if you are capable, good for you, take the little book, get out of the aquarium.
while she was talking, the gentleman, seized by a sudden motion of satisfaction, had grabbed the book from her hand and headed towards the bottom of the aquarium, where the aquarium's subtitles appeared in our living room.
clinging to a letter M the gentleman finally arrived in our enormous living room, a tiny being, followed by the lady who continued with her enunciations, undeterred:

- and narrating what happens, as it happens.
over there there's a small door, let's take the small door and get away from these pandimensional beings, good. good!
beyond the small door the gentleman and the lady found themselves in the city traffic, on the momentary road in front of the bus stop XXX waiting for it, for an unspecified time.
- you must harmoniously follow the movements and let things happen in the way they can happen, there, there, behead the demon, bravo!
TAGLIA

with a sudden move the gentleman had drawn a katana with a white mother-of-pearl hilt from the air and had beheaded a guy who had appeared out of nowhere to attack him.
- just like in highlander! and now we can finally checkmate our opponent, get on the bus.
- and you're not coming?
- i'll wait for you when you get off.
